#  Simple Code using Puppeteer - Amazon Price Comparator

Hi!

### What you can expect

What the script does is just a comparation between the prices of amazon european departments, like UK, ES, IT, ES, DE and NL. 

### Installation

To start, you have to do the following commands: 

```
npm install
```

Now, you just have to go to the **index.js** file and change the *productID* variable for the Amazon Product ID that you want. 

Take advantage of this small project! :)
